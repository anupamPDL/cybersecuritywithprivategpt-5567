[cybersecuritywithprivategpt-5567] Operating Details
====================================

Generated On: 2024-12-04 03:05:43 UTC

.. note::
   **THIS DOCUMENTATION CREATION WAS AUTOMATICALLY TRIGGERED BY:** TSS Development Environment Container

   If this documentation was triggered by the TSS - then your solution is running in the TSS Development environment.  All ports and links will point to your TSS 
   development environment.

   If this documentation was triggered by your TML solution - then your solution is running in your TML solution container.  All ports and links will point to 
   your TML solution container.

   **If you have NOTHING running - most of the links and ports below WILL NOT WORK.**

   **If you have BOTH RUNNING - all of the links and ports below WILL WORK.**

   Also, this documentation is updated by the **LATEST** run of either the TSS or TML.

.. important::
   These are the operating details for your TML solution.  

   It is important to note that this documentation will 

   dynamically update with the **Runtime Ports** for your solution.

   The ports below were valid for the last run of your solution, and will 

   **not be valid if your [cybersecuritywithprivategpt-5567] container is NOT running**.

.. tip::
   You must have your [cybersecuritywithprivategpt-5567] container running before connecting to the Visualization and Airflow URLs.

TSS Docker Run Command
-----------------------
This is the TML Solution Studio Docker Run command.  Note for MAC users change amd64 to arm64 in the container name. 

.. note::
   docker run -d \-\-net=host \-\-env AIRFLOWPORT=9000  -v <change to your local folder>:/dagslocalbackup:z  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock:z  \-\-env GITREPOURL=https://github.com/anupamPDL/raspberrypi  \-\-env CHIP=amd64 \-\-env TSS=1 \-\-env SOLUTIONNAME=TSS  \-\-env EXTERNALPORT=35831  \-\-env VIPERVIZPORT=9005  \-\-env GITUSERNAME='anupampDL'  \-\-env DOCKERUSERNAME='anupampdl'  \-\-env MQTTUSERNAME='apmpdl'  \-\-env KAFKACLOUDUSERNAME=''  \-\-env KAFKACLOUDPASSWORD='<Enter your API secret>'  \-\-env READTHEDOCS='<Enter your readthedocs token>'  \-\-env GITPASSWORD='<Enter personal access token>'  \-\-env DOCKERPASSWORD='<Enter your docker hub password>'  \-\-env MQTTPASSWORD='<Enter your mqtt password>'  maadsdocker/tml-solution-studio-with-airflow-amd64

TSS Docker Run Command: Parameter Explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. list-table::

   * - **Parameter**
     - **Explanation**
   * - docker
     - This calls the docker engine
   * - -d
     - This runs your container in **detached** mode
   * - \-\-net=host
     - This give your container access to your host operating system
   * - -v
     - This stands for **volume mapping**.  It maps a local folder

       in your host machine to the folder in the container.  The value **z**

        means the container has **shared access** to your local folder.

        For example, -v /mylocal/folder:/dagslocalbackup:z, means map 

        /mylocal/folder (on my host machine) to **/dagslocalbackup**

        in the contaner.   This allows files generated in the container 

        to be automatically written to your local folder.

   particular number.

Your Solution External Port
-----------------------
This is the Docker Run command for your solution container.  Note ports may change at runtime. The solution documentation will update automatically.

.. important::
   TBD

   This is the external port that you can use when making an external connection to your TML solution for external data ingestion.  You will need this port in the `REST <https://tml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tmlbuilds.html#step-3b-i-rest-api-client>`_, and `gRPC <https://tml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tmlbuilds.html#step-3c-i-grpc-api-client>`_ clients.

   In the TMUX window **Viper-produce**: :ref:`Your Solution TMUX Windows` 

Non-Solution vs Solution Ports
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Non-solution ports are only for TSS, this is because TSS includes a TML Dev environment to allow TML solution developers to test their solutions.

Solution ports are for your TML solution that you created and will deploy.

.. important::
   It is important to note the difference between the following ports:
    - AIRFLOWPORT and SOLUTIONAIRFLOWPORT
    - EXTERNALPORT and SOLUTIONEXTERNALPORT
    - VIPERVIZPORT and SOLUTIONVIPERVIZPORT

    The reason is because TSS includes a Development environment for TML 

    solutions, many times you will want to run your solution in Dev and run

    it in its own solution container for testing before you deploy your

    solution.  But, since ONLY ONE application can listen on a port, 

    we must assign a different port to the solutions so there is no 

    port conflict between applications in DEV and PROD.

    However, if you set all port to -1, TSS will randomly choose

    free ports for you.  The reason for setting the ports with an 

    actual number that is NOT -1, is if you want to scale your TML solution

    with Kubernetes and producing data using REST or gRPC and do not want

    ports to keep changing and breaking your app.

Your Solution Dashboard URL
-----------------------
This is the visualization URL for your TML dashboard. Note ports may change at runtime.  The solution documentation will update automatically.

.. important::
   This will appear AFTER you run Your Solution Docker Container

Your Solution Log File Dashboard

Your Solution Dashboard URL: Parameter Explanation
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. list-table::

   * - **Parameter**
     - **Explanation**
   * - http://localhost:TBD/<html file>
     - This is the URL pointing to an html file running inside your solution container.

       Refer to: `TML Real-time dashboards <https://tml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/dashboards.html>`_
   * - SOLUTIONVIPERVIZPORT=TBD
     - This is the port `Viperviz <https://tml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_ is listening on.
   * - topic
     - This is the topic that the TML binary `Viperviz <https://tml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html>`_ 

       is reading (consuming) in Apache Kafka and sending it to your broweser over websockets.  
   * - offset
     - This value tells the Viperviz binary to read the latest real-time data. 

       **offset=-1**, means to go to the end of the data stream and get the latest record.
   * - groupid
     - This can be empty. 
   * - rollbackoffset
     - This is the number of offsets to **rollback** the data stream from the **offset** value.

       Note: If you increase this number, Viperviz will send more data to your browser.  

       But be carefull, too much data may crash your browser or computer.
   * - topictype
     - Leave as is.
   * - append
     - This tells your html file whether to append or not the data streaming to your browser.

       If append=0, the html will not apend, if append=1, then data will accumulate in your browser.
   * - secure
     - This tells Viperviz whether to encrypt your data to the browser.  

       If secure=1, data are encrypted, secure=0 no encryption.
